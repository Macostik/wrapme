\cf3 Your information collected through the Services may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Ravenpod, its Affiliates or Service Providers maintain facilities. Ravenpod, its Affiliates and Service Providers may transfer information that we collect about you, including personal information, across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world.

\fs50 \cf2 Inappropriate Content
\fs30 \cf0 \
\pard\pardeftab720
\cf0 \
\pard\pardeftab720
\cf3 We remove content that doesn\'92t follow the meWrap terms (e.g. nudity, bullying, graphic violence and spam). If you come across something on meWrap that doesn't follow the meWrap Terms, use the report link near the post or photo to submit a report. User-generated content considered inappropriate will be removed from meWrap within 24 hours. We also reserve the rights to remove the user account that generated the inappropriate content.\cf0 \

\pard\tx220\tx720\pardeftab720\li720\fi-720\ri0
\cf3 For content that is covered by Intellectual Property rights, including photos and videos (IP content), you specifically give us the following permission, subject to your Wrap settings: you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use any IP content that you post on or in connection with Ravenpod (IP License). This License terminates when you delete your IP content or your account. However, if content has been shared with others in a Wrap, it will remain in the Wrap unless the Wrap owner deletes it.\cf0 \
\cf3 When you delete IP content, it is deleted in a manner similar to emptying the recycle bin on a computer. However, removed content may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time (it will not be available to others, unless it is part of a Wrap shared with other users, as stated above).\cf0 \
